## Alien Shooter 3: How to Play and Tips
 
Alien Shooter 3 is a game that requires quick reflexes, strategic thinking, and teamwork. Here are some tips on how to play and survive the alien onslaught.
 
- Choose your class wisely. Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as different weapons and abilities. For example, the Gunner is good at dealing damage and suppressing enemies, the Demolisher is good at blowing things up and creating chaos, the Technician is good at hacking and deploying turrets, the Doc is good at healing and reviving teammates, and the Recon is good at scouting and sniping.
- Upgrade your weapons and implants. As you progress through the game, you will earn money and experience that you can use to upgrade your weapons and implants. Weapons can be customized with different attachments and mods that improve their performance and functionality. Implants can enhance your stats and skills, such as health, speed, damage, accuracy, etc.
- Use cover and movement. The aliens will swarm you from all directions, so you need to use cover and movement to avoid getting overwhelmed. You can crouch behind objects, slide under obstacles, roll to dodge attacks, sprint to escape danger, and jump over gaps. You can also use environmental hazards, such as barrels, crates, pipes, etc., to damage or distract the aliens.
- Work as a team. Alien Shooter 3 is a co-op game that requires teamwork and communication. You can play with up to two other players online or offline. You can also use voice chat or emotes to communicate with your teammates. You need to coordinate your actions, share resources, cover each other's backs, and revive each other when downed.
